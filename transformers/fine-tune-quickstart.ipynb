I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

I am in Vegas for the Mr. Olympia expo and after seeing all the healthy fit people one of the people in our group wanted to eat at this fattening restaurant. I had never been here, but was very hungry after walking all day, and being off my diet for over 8 months. Great way to celebrate with this high calorie restaurant. \\n\\nThe first thing you notice in front of the restaurant is a scale...yes to weigh yourself. Apparently they promote being oversized, since all those over 350 lbs. eat free!! Our whole group weighed ourselves just to see how much we would weigh after eating here. Upon entering we were greeted by nurses and given a hospital patient gown. It was the best how very themed the restaurant was getting all customers into their world. This created a wonderful atmosphere for us to lose ourselves and enjoy the moment. They are known for the highest calorie burger with the quadruple bypass burger. It has 4 1/2lb. patties with cheese chili, onion tomato and pickles. Basically also everything is cooked in lard to raise the calories even more! The burger alone was 8000 calories. I added fries also cooked in lard, so who knows how much more calories that added! I also got a strawberry daiquiri that came with a personalized prescription bottle with your name printed on it. The bottle was 3.4 oz of a shot of alcohol. This was a heavy, high calorie meal that I ate completely but felt guilty and shame at the same time. \\n\\nEverything tasted good, but it was all about the experience of the restaurant and how the theme of it enthralls you while eating there. If you don't manage to finish your burger, you will get spanked. Yes, spanked by one of the nurses with a wooden paddle. Very funny to see when it happened. I would come back here again, but only with friends. The reason why is to enjoy the experience. I didn't think the food was all that great, but still good. \\n\\nI would recommend this place to all first timers and all those who love burgers. I'm really giving it 3 stars for the food, and the extra star for the theme given at the restaurant. Hope this helps you decide.</td>\n",

Best.sandwich.ever. I've always enjoyed the Kilt Lifter and the 8th Street Ale beer, but after going there last week, my new favorite is the Hop Knot IPA. I'll be going back soon just for that! I have fun memories of happy hours back in the day at the original Four Peaks in Tempe and while I enjoy going to the location in Scottsdale, too, there's something authentic about going to the one in Tempe. I love the true brewery atmosphere and that it's somewhat hidden, tucked back off major streets. Always a winner!</td>\n",

So good they don't taste gluten-free? Hell yeah, I'll make that claim!\\n\\nThe pumpkin and lemon loafs ($5) are addictive: I ate one small loaf in a day...by myself...and then I ate another one...don't judge me! The pumpkin tart ($2.50) is also really good.\\n\\nThe muffins ($2) come in blueberry, orange cranberry and chocolate chip, and are on the spongy side but their flavor is spot on. \\n\\nThe cookies ($2), however, aren't done right; the sugar cookies are slathered in what can only be described as a suspicious amount of frosting. The other varieties, like chocolate chip and walnut chocolate chip, are just too crunchy to be enjoyable. What can I say? I like soft cookies.\\n\\nIf you're gluten-free this is a good place to stock up on pizza crust and pancake mixes, bread, muffins or any other pastry mix your heart desires; the lady in front of me bought fifty bucks worth of stuff!\\n\\nThe girls behind the counter that rock some of the cutest haircuts in all of PGH are willing to answer any questions or explain that you need to cook the pizza at a higher temperature to get the crust the right texture.

I get my \\\"sandwich\\\" and it's a little squished bagel with a gross omelette inside with tiny bits of bacon and tomato, like a drop of some white cheese, and some wilted lettuce, really un satisfying. The booth we were sitting at was so freezing that our food was cold within 5 minutes. The manager offered to get me something else so I just asked for a mixed berry smoothie to  go to play it safe. I thought it tasted kind of milky so I opened the lid and there was a huge pile of whip cream, yuck. Since when do breakfast sandwiches come with lettuce and smoothies come with whipped cream?
